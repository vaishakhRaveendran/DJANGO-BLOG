You start by creating a new project...
Then you would create a new app
you need to add app blog.Blogconfig in the project dajango_blog.setting files
You also need to add the urls in django_blog and blog urls file
Inside the template folder of each app you need to create a subdirectory of same app name......
makemigrations just detect changes and prepare django for updating the table..
migrate command will cause set up the auth table.
createsuperuser will create a new super user..('vaishakhraveendran' ,'l@xmi2421')
staffuser status would give the user permission to log in to admin panel...
Migrations allows the user to make changes to the database even after created and values inserted.If we dont got provision for migrations
then we would have to run complex sql code instead to change the schema...(makemaigrations->migrate)

shell >>>>>>>>>> Interact with database directly...
Register the models in admin.py to show up in the admin panel
